I want to build a professional, AI-powered Indian vegetarian cooking suggestion web app using Python and Flask on Replit.

👨‍🍳 Purpose:
The app helps Indian users decide what to cook. They enter or select ingredients they have, and the app suggests 5–10 Indian vegetarian dishes they can make at home — with full steps explained like an Indian mom would.

🛠️ Functional Features:
1. Ingredient Input:
   - Multi-select checkboxes or tags
   - Manual text input supported

2. Recipe Matching Logic:
   - Compare user ingredients with a local recipe dataset (`recipes.json` or dict in Python)
   - Suggest dishes based on % of matched ingredients
   - Show best 5–10 matches with:
     - Dish name
     - Match %
     - Missing ingredients
     - Estimated cook time
     - Step-by-step cooking instructions in natural, home-style Indian English

3. Filters to Include:
   - ❌ No Onion/Garlic
   - ✅ Jain
   - 🕉️ Satvik
   - ⚡ Quick recipes (<20 min)
   - 🧘 Healthy recipes
   - 🍽️ Meal type selector: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks

4. Save Favorites Feature:
   - Add ❤️ “Save to Favorites” button (use localStorage or Replit DB)

5. Reset Button:
   - Reset ingredients and reload suggestions

🎨 UI / Design Requirements:
- Mobile-friendly and clean layout
- Use **TailwindCSS** via CDN
- Color theme: soft Indian tones (light saffron, green, off-white)
- Beautiful sticky header: “Aaj Kya Banaye?”
- Card-style layout for dish suggestions with:
   - Rounded corners
   - Drop shadow
   - Icons (e.g., 🕒 for time, ✅ for matches)
- Footer with version and credit: “v1.0 – Made by Bhanu”

🤖 GPT-4 AI Integration:
When a user clicks on “Cook This”:
- Call the GPT-4 API using OpenAI
- Send the selected dish name + user’s current ingredients
- AI should return:
   - Step-by-step cooking instructions in friendly tone
   - Suggestions for substitutions (e.g., “Use jeera instead of ajwain”)
   - Tips like: “Add hing for digestion” or “Use mustard oil for aroma”
   - Cultural context if possible (e.g., “Popular Sunday breakfast in Punjab”)
- Display AI response below the recipe or in a modal popup

🗂️ Files to Create:
1. `main.py` – Flask backend with all logic
2. `templates/index.html` – TailwindCSS styled frontend
3. `recipes.json` – Sample dataset (include at least 5–10 recipes to start)
4. Optional: Small `script.js` to handle favorite button + filters

🧾 Sample structure for `recipes.json`:
